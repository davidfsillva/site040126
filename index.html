      <h2>Android History</h2>
      <p>
        Android is an operating system originally created in 2003 by the company Android Inc., with the initial idea of being used in digital cameras. However, in 2005, Google acquired the company and shifted the project’s focus to mobile phones. In 2007, Google officially announced Android along with the Open Handset Alliance, promoting an open and free system for manufacturers, and in 2008 the first Android smartphone was released, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1). From then on, the system grew rapidly due to its customization options and adoption by several major brands such as Samsung, Motorola, LG, and Xiaomi. For many years, Android versions were named after desserts, like Cupcake, KitKat, and Oreo, until in 2019 Google began using only numbers. Today, Android is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, present not only in smartphones but also in tablets, TVs, cars, and other smart devices.

      <h2>The first version</h2>
      <p>
        The first version of Android, called **Android 1.0, was officially released in 2008 alongside the first smartphone to use the system, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1). This initial version already included important features that would later become standard, such as integration with Google services (Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Calendar), web browsing with its own browser, notifications in the top status bar, and the Android Market, which later became the Google Play Store. The system did not yet have a virtual keyboard, requiring a physical keyboard, and its interface was simple and not very customizable. Even with its limitations, the first version of Android was essential, as it demonstrated the potential of an open, free, and constantly evolving system, marking the beginning of Android’s worldwide popularization.
